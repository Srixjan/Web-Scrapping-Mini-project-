Web Scraping Mini Project ⚽

This is a mini web scraping project built using Python. The goal of the project is to extract football-related data from a website and present it in a structured tabular format for easy analysis.

📌 Features

Scrapes football data (teams, players, stats, etc. depending on source).

Cleans and organizes the extracted information.

Displays results in a structured pandas DataFrame.

Can be extended to save data into CSV/Excel for further use.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Requests – for sending HTTP requests

BeautifulSoup (bs4) – for parsing HTML content

Pandas – for cleaning and displaying data in tabular format

Jupyter Notebook – for development and demonstration

📂 Project Structure
📦 Web-Scraping-Mini-Project
 ┣ 📜 Project-1[Web Scrapping].ipynb   # Jupyter Notebook with code & output
 ┣ 📜 README.md                        # Project documentation
 ┗ 📜 requirements.txt                 # List of dependencies (optional)

🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Srixjan/Web-Scrapping-Mini-project-.git
cd Web-Scrapping-Mini-project-


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Project-1[Web Scrapping].ipynb


Run all cells to see the scraped football data.

📊 Sample Output

The notebook extracts and presents football data in tabular form, such as:

Rank	Team	Points	Matches Played	Wins	Losses
1	Team A	85	38	27	3
2	Team B	80	38	25	5

(Example table – actual data depends on scraping source)

💡 Future Improvements

Automate scraping for multiple pages.

Export results to CSV/Excel/Database.

Build a simple Flask/Django app to serve results.

Add visualization for trends and insights.

Would you like me to also create a requirements.txt file (listing requests, bs4, pandas, etc.) so that others can run it easily?
